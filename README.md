This is directly copied from https://dev.to/paurakhsharma/microservice-in-python-using-fastapi-24cc to help me understand fastapi as well as brush up my python.
Enough of just DevOps !!!

## Now comes a demo project on top of fastapi
I have few resources available, I need to create a distributed application

### Redis for cache - memcache
### Postgresql for database
### Message queue KAFKA or RabbitMQ TBD
### Python based backend dockers
### Frontend TBD vue.js or flutter
